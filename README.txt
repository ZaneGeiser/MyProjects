A collection of the things that I have independently coded. It's not an
exhaustive colletion but a highlight reel and is something that I am continuing
to work on.

The BlackJack Game is a text based version of the aforementioned game and is
played by running the play.py file from a command prompt. It's a quick read of
my understanding of object oriented programming and its implemetaion within
Python.

Th Roof-Rack-Scraper is something I created in tangent to my work at Roof Rack
and Towbar World. This is the project I set for myself as a way to show myself
that I have learned Python to a basic level. It is built of of scrapy, an open
source webscraping tool "https://scrapy.org/". There were serveral challenges to
completing this project to the end of the first goal: create a CSV price list of
our main competitiors online pricing. First, I had to dig deep into the
documentaion of scrapy to conceptulize how to achieve my goal. Then I had to
devise efficient metods for cleaning my data from real sources. For example I had
to create a method for returning the part number from a string. I worked through
several iterations of the project to make it faster, more polite, and more accurate.
the next goal for the project is to learn how to package the program to run on
company servers and update our website pricing according to our own rules on
competing pricing.
